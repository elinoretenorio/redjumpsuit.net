<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="manage" class="size-full wp-image-1092 aligncenter" height="384" src="http://www.redjumpsuit.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/manage.png" title="manage" width="575"/></p>

__features include the following:__

*    job poster does not need to register for an account
*    no need to login
*    no forgetting passwords
*    can manage (edit or delete) older posted jobs without accessing the job's email
*    job poster only needs the most recent email received when his/her job was posted
*    will not affect any of your customizations
*    supports pagination as well


this hack is a sort of workaround so that people would no longer need to keep their old publish job confirmation just so they can edit or deactivate their jobs, the most recent publish email would be enough to access all the job poster's previous job ads (where the job poster used the same email address to post.)

if you are interested in this hack, __simply make a PayPal donation__ (US$10 and up preferably) to this post (if you have benefited from any of my previous work) and you will receive the full source code and installation instructions. 

:)

__Update: __This add-on is now available for jobberBase 1.9.1, read about it here:
