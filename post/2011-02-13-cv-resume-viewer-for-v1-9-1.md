### CV/Resume Viewer for v1.9.1

Feb 13, 2011

does your job posters complain sometimes that they are not receiving applications that are being sent to them? how about wanting to retrieve an applicant information for the jobs posted on your website?

this simple solution is for those looking at adding the ability for their jobberBase job board's employers/posters to view job applications online instead of relying on the email applications sent to them.

instead of just send the applicant information to the job posters, this CV/Resume Viewer for 1.9.1 will store the applicant's basic information as well as the applicant's resume on your website's database. your job posters will then have access to the list of the applications sent on their jobs online through a link sent to them when they first posted the job.
