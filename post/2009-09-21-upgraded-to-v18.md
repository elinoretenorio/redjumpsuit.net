### Upgraded to v1.8

Sep 21, 2009

i've been busy converting all my codes to v1.8 that just came out a couple of days ago so if you sent me an email requesting for customization, i might be a little slow in replying so please be patient :)

the 4 major add-ons i created has just been converted to v1.8 and is now available for purchase. the previous version v1.7 will still be available for those who have this version but is no longer wanting to upgrade to v1.7 (i am not kidding, it was a lot of work!)

i am coming out with a jobberBase add-on that you can use to showcase products/items online by giving you options to upload photos for the ads you post. this will include lightbox2 on the photos. will give more updates soon!
