Dec 05, 2010

some of you have asked if it's possible to backfill your job board using excel or CSV, i don't have an off-the-shelf solution but i have a base script to automate this and can be customized to suit variety of needs.

if you are looking for this solution, please contact me with the following information:
1) sample of your excel or CSV file you want to upload
2) format of how you want the data displayed in your job board
3) provide types and categories (in your import data) and how it maps to the types and categories in your job board
4) a link to your job board where the excel or CSV file is to be uploaded
