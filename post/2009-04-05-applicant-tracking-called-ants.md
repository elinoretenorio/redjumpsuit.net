### Applicant Tracking called "A(n)ts"

Apr 05, 2009

I recently stumbled upon this open source applicant tracking system called <a href="http://www.applicant-tracking-system.org/" target="_blank">A(n)ts</a> based on the popular Mantis Bug Tracking system. I installed and got it working pretty quick and I was impressed with how extensive the system is without being uber-complex. If you are in dire need of an applicant tracking system but didn't want to spend on a commercial app, give A(n)ts a spin and save yourself some hard-earned penny!
