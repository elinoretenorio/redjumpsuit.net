### Your job board's own short URL

Oct 12, 2010

what better way to promote your job board site than to have your very own short URL links? i found this to be true for the couple of online services i started. if you are looking at creating your own short URL service for your jobberBase job board, then look no more! contact me at __myredjumpsuit \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com__ if you are interested in having your own short URL service integrated to your jobberBase job board.

see a working sample at:
<a href="http://twitter.com/trabaho4me" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/trabaho4me</a>

using the url shortening:
<a href="http://phlpn.es" target="_blank">http://phlpn.es</a>
