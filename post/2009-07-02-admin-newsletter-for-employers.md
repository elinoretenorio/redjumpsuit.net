Jul 02, 2009

this is a premium script and is a spin-off of the customization i previously created called [simple email subscription](http://www.redjumpsuit.net/2009/06/05/simple-email-subscription/). while the other was for applicants and job seekers, this customization is for jobberBase-powered site administrators to be able to send newsletters or announcements to its employers, recruiters or anyone who has posted a job on the site.  here are the list of features:

*   select whether to send a newsletter or an announcement
*   send your message to distinct job poster emails (no duplicate)
*   admin receives a copy of the messages sent to job posters
*   job posters are automatically subscribed to the mailing list
*   employers or job posters can unsubscribe anytime
