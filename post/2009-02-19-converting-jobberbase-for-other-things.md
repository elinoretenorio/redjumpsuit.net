### Converting jobberBase for Other Things

Feb 19, 2009

I have heard some people post on the __Jobberbase__ forum asking about using it for something other than jobs. Looking at the code, JB relies heavily on the URLs /job, /jobs, /jobs-in, /jobs-at etc. making it really tough to simply use the application for something else.

With this in mind, I will be coming up with a "__conversion__ __service__" for those who want to do just that.

The first converted Jobberbase I've started my work on is for travel agents/agencies, using URLs /deal, /deals, /deals-in, /deals-at etc. I'll put up a demo website as soon as it is done.

In case anyone is interested in exploring this service more, feel free to email me!
