### Printer-Friendly Version

May 21, 2009

today i had an interesting customization request from a website in spain. they need to be able to display a printer-friendly version of the ad.

so i created the printer-friendly script and placed it just above the posted date when viewing the job ad. when the user clicks on this link, it will pop a window with a stripped down version of the ad and a link to send it to the printer.  the output looks like this:
