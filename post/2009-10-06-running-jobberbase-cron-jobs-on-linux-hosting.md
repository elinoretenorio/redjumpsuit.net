### Running jobberBase cron jobs on Linux hosting

Oct 06, 2009

if you are wondering why your cron jobs are not executing, it could be that your [hosting](http://www.redjumpsuit.net/2009/12/29/jobberbase-hosting/) does not accept the cron job format of jobberBase. well, don't be blue as there is hope in your dilemma!

found this free website called <a href="http://www.onlinecronjobs.com" target="_blank">__OnlineCronJobs__</a> does the trick and does it very nicely (you get 5 cron jobs free for every domain.) you will need to verify your domain first and once verified, you can start setting up your free cron jobs.

one good tip if you expect your cron to run  longer, just uncheck the logging option. as this is a free service, please folks, let's be nice. we don't want to bring down their servers and chase them out of business! ;)
