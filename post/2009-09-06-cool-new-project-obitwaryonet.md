### Cool New Project - Obitwaryo.net

Sep 06, 2009

last week i had a chance to work on an uber-cool __jobberBase__ project called <a href="http://www.obitwaryo.net" target="_blank" title="Obitwaryo.net">Obitwaryo.net</a> which is an obituaries listing service in the Philippines (where I am currently based.) this is one of the very different implementation of jobberBase and something that you probably won't see anywhere that anyone might have done.

it features several stuff like:

*    dynamic paypal donation button
*    short URL generation (for posting on microblogs)
*    adding comments (with pagination)
*    twitter auto-posting, etc.

i'm pretty happy with how it turned out and am excited to see this site grow. be sure to check it out!

if you are interested in any of the customizations i created for  <a href="http://www.obitwaryo.net" target="_blank" title="Obitwaryo.net">Obitwaryo.net</a> that you want to add on your website, just let me know :)
