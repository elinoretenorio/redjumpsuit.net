### SLSfC + Subscription/Credits

Feb 17, 2009

Hi, so I have been working on the subscription/credits portion of SLSfC and it's close to being done. I am thinking if I should include this on the standard package or if this should come as an add-in.

The subscription/credits module will update the client account (using their unique email address) to indicate whether they are in subscription mode or will be using credits so they can post an ad and for how long. The maintenance script in Jobberbase will handle cleaning up past-due accounts and will give the client option to renew when desired.

Screenshot of the Subscription/Credit module will be available this week.
