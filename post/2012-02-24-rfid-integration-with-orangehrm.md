### RFID integration with OrangeHRM

Feb 24, 2012

From the <a href="http://www.orangehrm.com/" target="_blank">OrangeHRM</a> website:
>  OrangeHRM is the worldâ€™s most popular Open Source Human Resource Management Software (HRMS) with over 1,000,000 users globally.
If you are familiar with __OrangeHRM__, you will know that employees are able to punch-in/punch-out from the OrangeHRM system through their accounts. This can be pretty tedious when an employee only has a 15min break (and it will take him 3-5mins just to log back to OrangeHRM, find the link and press the timelog button.)

A simple solution was to automate the punch-in/punch-out act of the employee using an keyfob or swipe card on an RFID scanner that is connected to the OrangeHRM system.

I created a crude workaround here using that concept of a basic RFID scanner. Employees can punch-in/punch-out using a designated ID card (instead of logging into the OrangeHRM site) and their timelog goes straight to the OrangeHRM timelog as if the users have punch-in/out using their account.
