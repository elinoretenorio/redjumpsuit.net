### Simple Login System for Companies (SLSfC)

Feb 16, 2009

This has been __deprecated__ and was replaced by [jobberBase v1.8 w/ 4 Major Add-Ons](http://www.redjumpsuit.net/2009/09/22/list-of-features-added-to-v18/)

~~

Hi everyone,

This week, I will be releasing __SLSfC__ for Jobberbase as a package that people can buy and install themselves. It will have the same directory structure as the Jobberbase v1.6 code base but only including the files that have been added or updated. All updates to the original code are  commented, so if you have experience with Jobberbase this should be easy to install. Also, a list of all updated and added files is compiled for easier integration.

Keep checking the website back!

In the meantime, you may demo Jobberbase+SLSfC here:
