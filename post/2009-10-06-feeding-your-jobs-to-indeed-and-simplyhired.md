### Feeding your jobs to Indeed and SimplyHired

Oct 06, 2009

the past week i had the chance to work on creating jobberBase XML feeds for Indeed and SimplyHired. at first i thought it was daunting. but it was all good in the end.

i would say though, the model for which these 2 sites operate is actually not compatible with jobberBase since first and foremost (at least for indeed) they do no accept postings for sites that are free and for sites that has google ads on it. so before embarking on an effort to get your feeds to indeed and simplyhired, you might want to check first their criteria or qualification.

__On backfilling jobs:__

If you have an __Indeed Publisher ID__, you should be able to backfill your job board with Indeed jobs that you can actually monetize.


<div align="center"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Indeed API backfill add-on for jobberBase 1.9.1
for US$99*</strong>
</span></div>

<div align="center"><a href="#" onclick="startGateway('NDk2NjI0');"><img alt="" class="none" src="http://www.redjumpsuit.net/wp-content/uploads/files/download.jpg"/></a></div>

__Requirement:__
1) jobberBase v1.9.x installed (and running)

__Features:__
1) No database modification
2) Setup the backfill jobs as cron jobs to run at your preferred interval
3) No double-posting of the same jobs from the same network
4) It will back fill jobs for all your job categories (and location if wanted)

Once you download the Indeed API backfill add-on, be sure to read the README.txt file for more information and instruction on how to install and configure.
