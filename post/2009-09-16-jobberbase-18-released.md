get it here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jobberbase/" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/jobberbase/</a>

if you didn't know, i released the first ever site built using the new jobberBase 1.8 code base (at that time its most updated trunk version ~Sept 1) :)

as usual, i will take snapshots of the comparison of v1.7 and v1.8, and i am also in the process of updating all my custom code to make it compatible with the new version.

if you are thinking of upgrading and you have tons of customizations from the earlier version, you would be better off starting from the v1.8 version and import your stuff from v1.7 instead of trying to do "upgrade"
