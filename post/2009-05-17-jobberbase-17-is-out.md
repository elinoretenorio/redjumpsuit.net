### jobberBase 1.7 is out!

May 17, 2009

so i had to get my hands wet with  __jobberBase v1.7__ that came out some 15hrs ago. i'm sure a lot of people are gonna be interested to see what changes to expect in the new version.

these are the things you will see changed right off the bat:

*   new: db folder to build tables is now on the app root folder when you unzip it
*   new: control the application interval limit per IP address using the config file (sounds similar to the mod i did before)
*   new: post a job (admin)
*   new: add/edit cities (admin)
*   new: number of views per ad on the jobs list (admin)

i am also planning to do a code-by-code comparison of v1.6 and v1.7 when i have some time to those who are interested to know more up to that detail/level. this will help a lot when upgrading from the last version to the new one.
