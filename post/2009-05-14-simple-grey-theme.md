_Check out [__Simple Themes Pack for jobberBase v1.8__](http://www.redjumpsuit.net/2009/11/10/simple-themes-pack-for-jobberbase-v1-8/)_

if you are tired of seeing every other jobberBase website look almost the same as your default jobberBase website, here is a very __simple grey theme__ that you can use just to change the color scheme a bit. you can see how it looks like <a href="http://www.redjump.co.cc/jobberbase/" target="_blank">here</a>.

to use this theme, rename your screen.css on your /css folder, then download this <a href="http://www.redjump.co.cc/jobberbase/css/screen.css" target="_blank">file</a> and save it on that same folder.

hope y'all like it!
