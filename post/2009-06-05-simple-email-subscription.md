### Simple Email Subscription

Jun 05, 2009

i just finished wrapping up a __Simple Email Subscription__ module for jobberBase. here's what the simple email subscription does:

*   users can subscribe to any/all of the categories
*   notification will be sent whenever a new job is posted for that job's category
*   on the notification sent to the subscribers, an unsubscribe link is provided in case users no longer want to receive emails for that job category
*   admin has the option to choose to send an email for that job to all its category's subscribers
*   once notification has already been sent, the button to send the notification will be disabled (to prevent spamming your subscribers)


and here are some screenshots for you:
