### About Me

Jan 04, 2010

RedJumpsuit is just an alter-ego. In real life I never wear jumpsuits at all. During the time I started creating hacks for jobberBase a little over a year ago, I have been listening a lot to the band The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and so there goes the name. Since then, I have created dozens of free and paid hacks and have worked with numerous job sites looking to take their job boards to the next level.

I have enjoyed the past year and have developed increased passion for job boards and the recruitment industry. It has been a great adventure so far and new ideas still keep coming, so as long as they still keep coming, I will be here doing the stuff I totally love and dig.

My ultimate goal is to make a living doing freelancing stuff without having to keep a 9-5 job so please excuse me if sometimes I ask to get paid on the other stuff that I do, it's how I keep having the time and availability to create other free things that most of you enjoy. :)
