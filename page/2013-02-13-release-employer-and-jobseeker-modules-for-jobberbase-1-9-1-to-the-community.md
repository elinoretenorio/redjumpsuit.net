### Release Employer and Jobseeker modules for jobberBase 1.9.1 to the community

Feb 13, 2013

I have been working on the __Employer and Jobseeker modules for jobberBase 1.9.1__ for several months now and is considering releasing the source code to the public if I can raise enough funds to cover continuous development. I believe this is the most requested feature in the entire community and this will greatly benefit hundreds if not thousands of sites using jobberBase.

You can already preview a beta version [here](http://redjumpsuit.net/jb191upgrade/).

Aside from this, I also help with the community and has created many useful customizations that everyone has access to. Your contribution can help me do this even further, and provide better and more timely assistance to those in urgent need when necessary.

If you think this is something worth supporting, please help me fund this effort.
